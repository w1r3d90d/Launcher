This is the inital release of the project.  
There have been numorus previous versions but this is the first that I feel is worthy of sharing. 
See the included Demo.jpg to see what it should look like.
The Launcher creates upto 4 rows containing 9 buttons each.  It is very easy to expand this if you wish to do so.
The buttons are 128 pixles square are are generated from the config.ini file......sort of.  More on this later.
